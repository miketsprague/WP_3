<p>This school year, Michael Joiner has introduced a revolutionary writing class at UC Santa Barbara that teaches students to learn to <a href="http://writingspaces.org/sites/default/files/bunn--how-to-read.pdf">read like a writer</a> in an effort improve academic writing skills.</p>
<p>
	UCSB is one of ten schools in the “University of California” system and is ranked among the most prestigious universities in the world.  Michael Joiner, a graduate student in the Music Department, has stepped up to the plate to teach a ten week writing course on how to become a better writer. </p> 

<p>
	Joiner has organized the course, Writing 2, into three main segments: <b>Genre Identification and Comparison</b>, <b>Appropriate Literacy Practices in Academic Classrooms</b>, and <b>What Have We Learned in Writing 2</b>.
</p>


<div class="pullquote-left">Reading like a writer allows the reader to identify effective techniques implemented by the author that can be reused in his or her future writing projects.</div>

<p>
	The first segment of this course is driven by Mike Bunn’s <a href="http://writingspaces.org/sites/default/files/bunn--how-to-read.pdf">How to Read Like a Writer</a>, which proposes that the reader considers each text from the author's point of view. The students are supposed to use Bunn's strategy while reading to identify the techniques and conventions used by the author to deliver the purpose of the piece to a specific audience.
</p>
<p>
	In general, reading like a writer allows the reader to identify effective techniques implemented by the author that can be reused in his or her future writing projects.
</p>

<p>
	The second segment in this course deals with identifying different literacy practices in different contexts.  Students are taught an effective way to view these practices in a chapter written by Sunstein and Chiseri Strater, “Stepping in and Stepping Out”, from <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/FieldWorking.html?id=XLWdDA88rwAC">FieldWorking: Reading and Writing Research</a>.  
</p>

<p>
	Stepping in and stepping out refer to the concept of entering and exiting a culture different to the reader's.  Students learn that stepping into literacy can be achieved by observing the different forms of communication used by the people in a particular sub-culture.
</p>

<p>
	The final segment in the course deals with fine tuning of grammar and language, along with the concept of writing with clairty, as emphasized in Scott McCloud’s “Writing with Pictures” chapter from his book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=C1h_UE_CqDwC">Making Comics</a>.  It discusses five main ideas to writing a clear paper: moment, frame, image, word, and flow.  
</p>

<p>
	The students are given a project to write in a genre of their choice, then reflect upon it using techniques learned in class.
</p>

<p>
	Writing 2 is a mandatory course that all students must take before graduation at UCSB; its purpose is to teach students to be conscious and reflective of all of their future writing.
