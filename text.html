<p>This school year, Michael Joiner has introduced a revolutionary writing class at UC Santa Barbara that teaches students to learn to <a href="http://writingspaces.org/sites/default/files/bunn--how-to-read.pdf">read like a writer</a> in an effort improve academic writing skills.</p>
<p>
	UCSB is one of the ten schools in the “University of California” system and is ranked among the most prestigious universities in the world.  Michael Joiner, a graduate student in the Music Department, has stepped up to the plate to teach a ten week writing course on how to become a better writer. </p> 

<p>
	Joiner has organized the course, Writing 2, into three main segments: <b>Genre Identification and Comparison</b>, <b>Appropriate Literacy Practices in Academic Classrooms</b>, and <b>What Have We Learned in Writing 2</b>.
</p>

<p>
	The first segment of this course is driven by Mike Bunn’s <a href="http://writingspaces.org/sites/default/files/bunn--how-to-read.pdf">How to Read Like a Writer</a>.  This discusses the concept of thinking as if you were the one writing the paper.
	Reading like a writer allows the reader to identify writer’s techniques that are employed so that he can use them in his own works.  This also allows the reader to gain more insight to the purpose of the text.  The essay is broken up into several sections organizing the "what" and the "why", and concluding with the "how" with multiple sections on techniques, examples, and applications of reading like a writer.  In short, Bunn wants us to learn to read like a writer because it gives us insight into the passage and it helps us become better writers by observing the methodology used by the author and personally determining whether or not we feel that the methods they used were effective.

	The second segment in the course deals with identifying different literacy practices in different contexts.  An effective way to view these practices are to step in and step out of a culture, as written by Sunstein and Chiseri Strater in the chapter “Stepping in and Stepping Out” from <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/FieldWorking.html?id=XLWdDA88rwAC">FieldWorking: Reading and Writing Research</a>.  Stepping in and stepping out refer to the concept of entering and exiting a culture different to your own.  We can more broadly generalize this and apply it not just to culture, but to literacy too.  Stepping in to literacy would be to observe the different forms of communication used by the people in that group.

	The final segment in the course deals with fine tuning of grammar and language, along with the concept of writing with clairty, as emphasized in Scott McCloud’s “Writing with Pictures” chapter from his book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=C1h_UE_CqDwC">Making Comics</a>.  It discusses five main ideas to writing a clear paper: moment, frame, image, word, and flow.
